    <h1>THE BREATHE OF LIFE:AIR</h1>
    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>It is a mixture of
many gases like nitrogen, oxygen, carbon
dioxide and water vapour. It is interesting to
note that even the composition of air is the
result of life on Earth.The percentage of carbon
dioxide in our atmosphere is a mere fraction
of a percent because carbon dioxide is ‘fixed’
in two ways: (i) Green plants convert carbon
dioxide into glucose in the presence of
Sunlight(ii) many marine animals use
carbonates dissolved in sea-water to make
their shells.</p>

    <h2>THE ROLE OF ATMOSPHERE IN CLIMATE CONTROL
</h2> 
    <p>The atmosphere covering the
Earth, like a blanket. We know that air is a
bad conductor of heat.The atmosphere keeps
the average temperature of the Earth fairly
steady during the day and even during the
course of the whole year.On the surface of
the moon, with no atmosphere, the
temperature ranges from –190° C to 110° C.</p>

    <h2>THE MOVEMENT OF AIR:WINDS</h2> 
    <p>The relief brought by cool
evening breezes after a hot day.All these phenomena are the result of
changes that take place in our atmosphere
due to the heating of air and the formation of
water vapour. The atmosphere can be
heated from below by the radiation that is
reflected back or re-radiated by the land or
water bodies.On being heated, convection
currents are set up in the air.

    <h2>RAIN</h2>
    <p> In large parts ofIndia, rains are mostly brought by the south-west or north-east monsoonsSome amount of watervapour also get into the atmosphere becauseof various biological activities. This air alsogets heated.As the air rises, it
expands and cools. This cooling causes the
water vapour in the air to condense in the
form of tiny droplets.This air also
gets heated. The hot air rises up carrying the
water vapour with it.This condensation of 
water is facilitated if some particles could act
as the ‘nucleus’ for these drops to form
around.</p>
